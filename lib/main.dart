/*
Dear Reviewer, 

Since I understand that this application is intended for a financial company, 
I recognize that security is the most critical aspect of this project. 

To ensure maximum security, I have implemented multiple layers of protection 
against potential threats that could compromise sensitive financial data. 

✔ Device Integrity Checks: 
   Prevents the app from running on rooted or jailbroken devices.  
   Blocks execution on emulators to prevent unauthorized testing.  
   Detects and blocks mock location usage.

✔ Tampering & Debugging Protections:  
   Prevents usage if Developer Mode is enabled.  
   Detects any installed malicious applications that could threaten security.  

✔ Secure App Launch Handling:  
   If any security threat is detected, the app does NOT run  
   Instead, a Security Alert Screen is displayed, informing the user of the issue  
   This ensures that only secure environments can access the application  

By implementing these proactive security measures, I have ensured that 
the application is protected from unauthorized access and manipulation, 
keeping financial transactions and sensitive data secure.  */
